- Unique Gym ID Generation: Auto-generate an 8-character unique Gym ID. The system must ensure this formatted_gym_id is unique before saving.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark Black (#000000) for a modern, serious feel.
- Primary accent color: Yellow (#F5CB08) to serve as the main accent color. This will be used sparingly for highlights and important UI elements, creating visual interest and a sense of action.
- Accent color: Lime green (#BEF202). Analogous to yellow, the lime-green adds vibrance while not distracting from primary calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective, neutral feel.
- Use a consistent set of simple, line-based icons from Shadcn UI that are easy to understand at a glance.
- Emphasize clear, functional layout with a focus on ease of use. Main dashboard features a table listing gyms with a prominent button to create a new gym.
- Subtle transition animations when new data is loaded to provide a polished user experience.
